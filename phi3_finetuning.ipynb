He\\'s now a co-owner of School and hosting a challenge that will give you an opportunity to meet him in person while also allowing you to make a fat stack.\" \"Ramosi himself said that running a paid community is the simplest business model that you can run in 2024. And I couldn\\'t agree more. You don\\'t need any startup cash, any business experience, and you don\\'t need an audience or need to make content. This is the same business model that I used to make 263K as a senior in high school, and over $250,000 in revenue just last month at the age of 19.\" \"Comment Ramosi and I\\'ll send it for free.\"',\n",
              " '\"So, how do you separate yourself from your competition? Especially if you guys are offering essentially the exact same thing.\" \"Well in truth, what you need to create is something called a unique mechanism.\" \"And a unique mechanism is exactly that—it is a unique way that you are going to deliver results for your clients that\\'s different than how your competitors do it. We just don\\'t extract it and market it in our top of funnel marketing. If you\\'re able to create a word or phrase that describes your process, then in doing so, you will separate yourself from other people who haven\\'t created that word or phrase. For example, in my industry, there are a lot of people that help other people scale their businesses. But in our business, we have a few unique mechanisms such as the self-sustaining funnel, which is a concept or idea I\\'ve created on how to build an entire marketing system that feeds itself. Another example of a unique mechanism for our company is the member method, which is how we use subscription membership services to fuel our high-ticket businesses.\" \"So you could say that some of these things aren\\'t radical or totally different, but it\\'s because I have extracted them from our processes and put a name around them, that it separates us from our competition.\"',\n",
              " '\"So, the real second sauce is Audible, one of the largest companies in the world for subscription service, selling what is arguably information, right?\" \"Do you know how their system works? How people read books on Audible? Have you ever used it before?\" \"Oh, they have credits. They have credits. Yeah. Why do they have credits? To get recurring revenue. Because if somebody came in and they could get 500 books the first day, either they\\'d get 500 books the first day and then they\\'d cancel the membership the next month. Right, right, right. Or they\\'d be so overwhelmed, they wouldn\\'t know what to do that they would literally just cancel the subscription. There\\'s no way I\\'m getting my value out of this. So give them a credit each month. I give them a credit every month. And so we built in a full custom code system that gives people credits every month.\" \"And then I have a video called The Theory of Constraints Video. I\\'m just giving it away all on this. And it literally says, okay, from if you\\'re a beginner and you have zero money and no offer, all the way to you\\'re doing $1 million dollars a month, these are the different problems you\\'re gonna have and these are the different classes that solve these problems.\"',\n",
              " '\"Have you ever wondered how much your favorite influencers make?\" \"Well, I\\'m a Pocket Watcher and today we\\'re gonna be pocket watching Hamza.\" \"He is over 2.29 million subs on YouTube and runs a paid community to monetize his audience. It\\'s called Adoma School and he charges $129 per month for access and it looks like he has 1200 people paying for access making him over $150,000 every single month. A paid community is the best business model anyone can run to monetize an influencer\\'s audience and there is a massive opportunity for anyone to tap into this industry even if they aren\\'t an influencer. There\\'s millions of influencers out there with massive audiences that aren\\'t currently monetizing their audience and anyone can partner with an influencer and help them build a paid community to monetize their audiences and split the profits with the influencer. Even if you only took 10% from helping Hamza monetize his audience that would be 15K a month and I made a free guide explaining exactly how I did this and made over $100,000 profit last month and showing you exactly how you can do the same.\" \"Comment Hamza and I\\'ll send it to you for free.\"',\n",
              " '\"Most people don\\'t have businesses. They have promotions.\" \"They live on a revenue roller coaster where one month is high and the other month is a complete low. And the reason they have this is because they\\'re solely focused on marketing and getting upfront cash as quickly as possible.\" \"What I\\'ve learned after generating tens of millions of dollars online is that, in order to shift from that promotional rollercoaster that most people find themselves on into a real business with enterprise value, you need two main things. The first is product led growth, and that\\'s when your products sell themselves and ascend people into traditional products or services without you having to do any work. [...] And the second part of it is that you want to have recurring revenue. [...] So we launched a membership site. About 90 days ago at this point. And we\\'re generating tens of thousands of dollars a month.\" (Implicit) By sharing the speaker\\'s personal success with the approach, the call-to-action is implied rather than directly stated. The viewer is led to consider implementing the same strategies of product led growth and recurring revenue models for their own business, but there is no direct action like \"click here\" or \"sign up now\". It may prompt viewers to look into the speaker\\'s methods or contact them for further information.']"
