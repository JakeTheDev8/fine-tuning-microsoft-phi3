# Fine-tuning Microsoft Phi-3 Model with LoRa/QLoRA Techniques

## Introduction
This repository contains code and instructions to fine-tune the Microsoft Phi-3 model using LoRa/QLoRA techniques. The fine-tuning process aims to generate scripts that follow the style and engagement hooks of a provided dataset. The fine-tuned model is then used to develop a Streamlit application for generating scripts based on user-provided topics.



REQUIREMENTS:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Steps to Fine-tune the Model

### 1. Dataset Preparation
- Use the provided dataset and format it to match the requirements for fine-tuning the Phi-3 model.

### 2. Fine-Tuning Process
- Set up a Google Colab notebook.
- Load the Microsoft Phi-3 model using the Hugging Face Transformers library.
- Implement LoRa/QLoRA techniques for fine-tuning the model.
- Use the provided dataset for few-shot prompting and prompt engineering.

### 3. Model Configuration
- Load the model in 8-bit or 16-bit precision to fit within the constraints of the free Colab GPU.

### 4. Evaluation
- Implement a method to evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as F1 score, true positives, false positives, and recall.

### 5. Script Generation
- Ensure the model can generate scripts based on user-provided topics that follow the same style and engagement hooks as the dataset.

### 6. Streamlit Application
- Develop a simple Streamlit application to allow users to input a topic and receive a generated script. The application should demonstrate the prompt, accept a topic input, and generate a script accordingly.

## Code Explanation

### Dataset Preparation
- The provided dataset is formatted to include 'Hook', 'Build Up', 'Body', and 'CTA' columns. These columns are concatenated to form a 'text' column, which is used for fine-tuning.

### Fine-Tuning Process
- The Phi-3 model is loaded using Hugging Face's Transformers library.
- LoRa/QLoRA techniques are implemented for fine-tuning the model, ensuring it learns from the provided dataset while preserving its original capabilities.
- Few-shot prompting and prompt engineering are applied using the dataset to enhance model performance.

### Model Configuration
- The model is loaded in 8-bit or 16-bit precision to optimize memory usage and fit within the constraints of the free Colab GPU.

### Evaluation
- A method is implemented to evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as F1 score, precision, recall, etc.

### Script Generation
- The fine-tuned model is capable of generating scripts based on user-provided topics. It follows the style and engagement hooks of the dataset.

### Streamlit Application
- A Streamlit application is developed to provide a user-friendly interface for generating scripts. Users can input a topic, and the application generates a script based on the input.
